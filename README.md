# REMOTE STATISTICS MONITOR
This program will allow a system to be monitored remotely. 
*in it's current state, not remotely, but it can be modified to do so*
This is a class assignment made to give me some practice with using ZeroMQ, as well as the publish and subscribe messaging pattern.
The goal is to get familiar with asynchronous messaging.
After this assignment has been turned in, I plan on revisiting it to make it better without the constraints.

# DEMO
todo

# How to use
Clone this repo. (or download the files)
open a terminal window and type "cd path/to/thisRepo'sfolder"
then you can type "make all" if you want to install the libraries needed, compile the program, run it, then clean the files up.
unfortunately, the only way to stop the programs from running right now is to kill them manually
For now, when you're done with the program, you can exit out of that terminal window or do ctrl+z or ctrl+c to interuppt it.
Just make sure that you run "make killall" so that your computer wont hold onto those processes haunting you. :D
This isn't ideal, but it is a small fix to make! (I'm just not making it now since this assignment is due tomorrow, and that wasn't a requirement)

NOTE: the x-axis is seconds since midnight of today in UTC! This was an assignment specification (i believe thats what it meant anyways)
The y-axis is in kB of free memory.
